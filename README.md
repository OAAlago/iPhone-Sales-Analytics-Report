### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Address Weak Sales Performance in Pakistan.
- Improve the Performance of Underperforming iPhone Models.
- Address the Declining Monthly Sales Trend.
- Address Low Demand for Less Popular Colors.
- Reduce the Risk of Slow-Moving Storage Options.
- Improve the Quality and Coverage of Future Sales Data.

### Limitations
- The dataset only covers transactions from Jan 1, 2025 to May 1, 2025. As a result, findings may not reflect long term sales trends.
- The analysis is limited to the countries present in the dataset and may not represent the company’s performance in other countries.
- The dataset has limited customer information limiting customer behavior analysis.
- The Price column is generalized, so there is no way to know if the price of each iPhone model is per country or standard iPhone price.
